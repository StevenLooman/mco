MCO
===

The Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO) lost communication due to a conversion error from force in pounds to Newton. Resulting, an erroneous trajectory was computed using this incorrect data.

The MCO library provides a means to correctly keep track of measured data without worrying about using measurements with different units.

MCO is loosely based on [JSR-275][1]. Concepts have been re-used from this library.
